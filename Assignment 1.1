1. Say True or False for the below statements:
• Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes? - TRUE
• Base R packages installed automatically? - TRUE
2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector?
When a arithmetic is performed on two or more vectors of different sizes, R repeats the shorter vector until it matches the longer vector to perform the arithmetic instead throwing an error. This is called Recycling of Vector.
3. Give an example of recycling of elements.
> c(5,6,7,8)+c(3,4)
[1]  8 10 10 12

Where c(3,4) repeat as c(3,4,3,4) to match the length of vector c(5,6,7,8)
